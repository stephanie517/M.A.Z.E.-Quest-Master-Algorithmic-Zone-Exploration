⚙️ **Algorithms Available**  

📌 **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**:  
A thorough, non-heuristic approach that evaluates all possible paths for accuracy.

🧩 **A\* Algorithm**:  
Combines Dijkstra's method with a heuristic to prioritize paths closer to the goal.

🔄 **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**:  
Explores all neighboring nodes layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path in unweighted mazes.

🔍 **DFS (Depth-First Search)**:  
Searches deeper into the maze before backtracking, suitable for exploring large areas.

↔ **WFS (Weighted First Search)**:  
Balances exploration with weighted prioritization for obstacles and detours.
