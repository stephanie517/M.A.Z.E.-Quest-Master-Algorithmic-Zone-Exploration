# M.A.Z.E. Quest: Master Algorithmic Zone Exploration

## Overview
**M.A.Z.E. Quest** is an educational and engaging pathfinding maze game where players guide a character from the start to the goal using pathfinding algorithms. The game showcases key computer science concepts by allowing players to experience how algorithms like **Dijkstra’s** and **A\*** solve complex pathfinding challenges. Players can select an algorithm and witness a real-time, step-by-step visual demonstration of its approach to finding the shortest path.

## Features
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose between Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm to see their different approaches to pathfinding.
- **Maze Customization**: Players can generate or customize maze layouts and set difficulty levels by adding barriers or special zones.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch as the selected algorithm navigates the maze, exploring paths and finding the optimal route.
- **Educational Pop-Ups**: Learn about each algorithm’s function, heuristics, and time complexity through interactive in-game explanations.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The game is designed to be responsive and playable across various devices and browsers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run M.A.Z.E. Quest locally, you will need:
- **Node.js** (for backend development)
- **A modern web browser** (for frontend compatibility)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/MAZE-Quest.git
   cd MAZE-Quest
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Play
1. **Select Algorithm**: On the start menu, choose either Dijkstra’s or A* as your pathfinding algorithm.
2. **Customize the Maze**: Create a maze layout by selecting difficulty levels or manually adding barriers to create obstacles.
3. **Start the Game**: Guide the character to the maze finish, watching as the algorithm calculates the optimal path.
4. **Learn and Experiment**: Experiment with different maze layouts and algorithm settings to see how each algorithm approaches the challenge.

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Handles the user interface, game visuals, and algorithm animations. Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- **Backend**: Manages pathfinding computations, custom maze storage, and score tracking. Built with Node.js.
- **Database**: Stores user progress, custom mazes, and leaderboard data (optional, based on game configuration).

## Algorithms Used

### 1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
A non-heuristic algorithm that calculates the shortest path to each point by evaluating all possible paths. It is thorough but may be slower in complex mazes.

### 2. A* Algorithm
Combines Dijkstra’s method with a heuristic that prioritizes paths closer to the goal, typically making it faster. Ideal for larger or more complex maze layouts.
