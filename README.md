## ⚙️ Algorithms Used

### 1. 📌 Dijkstra’s Algorithm
A non-heuristic algorithm that calculates the shortest path to each point by evaluating all possible paths. It is thorough but may be slower in complex mazes.

### 2. 🧩 A* Algorithm
Combines Dijkstra’s method with a heuristic that prioritizes paths closer to the goal, typically making it faster. Ideal for larger or more complex maze layouts.
